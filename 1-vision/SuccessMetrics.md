# Success Metrics — Remember Twelve

## Overview

Success for Remember Twelve is measured by **preservation, reflection, and engagement** — not just downloads or revenue. Our metrics should reflect whether families are building lasting memory archives and revisiting them over time.

---

## North Star Metric

### **Annual Twelve Completion Rate**

**Definition**: Percentage of active users who have at least one completed Twelve for each active circle by year-end.

**Target**:
- **Year 1**: 60% completion rate
- **Year 2**: 75% completion rate
- **Year 3**: 85% completion rate

**Why This Matters**: This metric captures our core promise—automatic, effortless memory preservation. If users complete their Twelves, we're delivering on our vision.

---

## Primary Metrics

### 1. **Reflection Engagement**

**Definition**: How often users revisit past Twelves (views per user per month).

**Targets**:
- **Year 1**: 2+ views/user/month
- **Year 2**: 3+ views/user/month
- **Year 3**: 4+ views/user/month

**Why**: Reflection is the product. Storage without revisiting has no value.

**Tracking**:
- Timeline view opens
- Year-over-year comparisons
- Time spent browsing past Twelves

---

### 2. **Multi-Circle Adoption**

**Definition**: Percentage of users with 2+ active circles.

**Targets**:
- **Year 1**: 40% of users
- **Year 2**: 55% of users
- **Year 3**: 65% of users

**Why**: Multi-circle usage validates our differentiation. Users who create circles for "Family," "Kids," "Extended Family," etc. are getting the full value.

**Tracking**:
- Average circles per user
- Circle creation rate
- Circle activity (photos added/curated)

---

### 3. **Archive Longevity**

**Definition**: Percentage of users with 3+ years of completed Twelves.

**Targets**:
- **Year 3**: 50% of Year 1 users still active
- **Year 5**: 60% of Year 1 users still active
- **Year 10**: 70% of Year 1 users still active

**Why**: We're building generational archives. Success means users stay for decades, not months.

**Tracking**:
- Cohort retention by year
- Number of archived Twelves per user
- Years of continuous usage

---

## Secondary Metrics

### 4. **Photo Connection Rate**

**Definition**: Percentage of users who successfully connect their photo libraries (Google Photos, iCloud, local storage).

**Target**: 90% of onboarded users

**Why**: Without photos, there's no product. This measures onboarding effectiveness.

---

### 5. **Curation Override Rate**

**Definition**: Percentage of users who manually swap AI-selected photos.

**Target**: 10-20% (Goldilocks zone)

**Why**:
- Too low (<10%) suggests users aren't engaged or AI selections are "good enough" but not inspectable
- Too high (>20%) suggests AI curation is failing or users don't trust it

---

### 6. **Export & Share Actions**

**Definition**: Number of export (PDF, print) or share (with family) actions per user per year.

**Target**: 1.5+ actions/user/year

**Why**: Exported/shared Twelves extend value beyond the app—physical prints, shared family moments.

**Tracking**:
- PDF exports
- Print service orders
- Share link sends
- Share acceptance rate

---

### 7. **Year-End Ritual Participation**

**Definition**: Percentage of users who engage with year-end review flow (November-January).

**Target**: 80% of active users

**Why**: Year-end is our "Super Bowl"—the moment when Twelves are finalized, reviewed, and celebrated.

**Tracking**:
- Year-end notification open rate
- Time spent in year-end review
- Tweaks made to finalized Twelves

---

## Health Metrics

These aren't success goals—they're warning signals.

### 8. **Photo Upload Gaps**

**Definition**: Users with 30+ consecutive days without new photos added to any circle.

**Threshold**: <15% of active users

**Why**: Long gaps suggest disengagement or photo sync issues.

---

### 9. **Circle Abandonment**

**Definition**: Circles with no activity (photo additions, views) in 90+ days.

**Threshold**: <20% of created circles

**Why**: Abandoned circles suggest unclear value or poor onboarding.

---

### 10. **Curation Confidence Score**

**Definition**: User-reported confidence in AI selections (periodic survey, 1-10 scale).

**Target**: 7.5+ average score

**Why**: Trust in AI curation is foundational. Low scores indicate algorithm issues or transparency gaps.

---

## Measurement Strategy

### Data Collection

1. **In-App Analytics**
   - User actions (views, exports, shares, swaps)
   - Session duration and frequency
   - Feature usage by circle

2. **Periodic Surveys**
   - Quarterly NPS (Net Promoter Score)
   - Semi-annual curation confidence survey
   - Post-year-end satisfaction survey

3. **Cohort Analysis**
   - Track retention by signup cohort
   - Measure metric progression over user lifetime
   - Identify drop-off points in user journey

4. **A/B Testing**
   - Curation algorithm variations
   - Onboarding flow changes
   - Notification timing and content

- ✅ 60% Twelve completion rate
- ✅ 90% photo connection rate
- ✅ 40% multi-circle adoption
- ✅ 2+ reflection views/user/month

**What Success Looks Like**: Families complete their first Twelve with minimal friction and start returning to view past months.

---

### **Phase 3: Generational Archive (Year 3+)**
- ✅ 85% Twelve completion rate
- ✅ 50% of Year 1 users still active
- ✅ 65% multi-circle adoption
- ✅ 4+ reflection views/user/month

**What Success Looks Like**: Families have multi-year archives spanning kids' growth, relationships, and milestones. Looking back across years becomes a cherished family activity.

---

## Anti-Metrics

Metrics we explicitly **do NOT optimize for**:

- **Daily Active Users (DAU)**: We're not a social network; low daily engagement is expected
- **Photos Uploaded**: Volume doesn't equal value—curation quality matters more
- **Time in App**: Long sessions aren't the goal; quick, meaningful reflection is
- **Viral Sharing**: We're private and family-focused, not virality-driven

---

## Review Cadence

- **Weekly**: Health metrics (upload gaps, circle abandonment)
- **Monthly**: Primary and secondary metrics review
- **Quarterly**: Cohort analysis, NPS, curation confidence surveys
- **Annually**: Phase goal assessment, metric target adjustments

---

## Final Note

These metrics will evolve as we learn. The goal isn't to hit every target—it's to understand whether we're delivering on our North Star: **"Preserve your year in twelve unforgettable moments — for every circle that matters."**

If the metrics drift away from that mission, we adjust the metrics—not the mission.
