## TL;DR

Our North Star: **"Preserve your year in twelve unforgettable moments — for every circle that matters."**

## Vision

**Remember Twelve** exists because our memories are scattered, overwhelming, and often forgotten. Families take thousands of photos, but almost none become lasting artifacts.

Remember Twelve changes that by giving **families, individuals, and connected groups** a **durable container for memories — automatically curated, beautifully presented, and permanently archived.**

In **Remember Twelve**, AI isn't just a tool — it's the archivist, storyteller, and designer that transforms your digital exhaust into a meaningful, yearly chapter of your life.

It:

- **Curates** — selects twelve meaningful photos per year using quality, emotion, and diversity signals.
- **Organizes** — builds distinct archives for each circle (Family, You, Kids, Cousins, etc.), automatically syncing shared memories.
- **Designs** — composes each year's "Twelve" into a clean, timeless visual layout ready to print or share.
- **Preserves** — stores every Twelve as a permanent archive you can revisit, compare, and reprint across decades.

When **Remember Twelve** succeeds, each family has a living bookshelf of its own story — twelve moments at a time.

## North Star

**"Preserve your year in twelve unforgettable moments — for every circle that matters."**

This means:

- Every user and family automatically receives their yearly Twelve archive.
- Each circle (family, individual, cousins, etc.) has its own AI-curated collection.
- Every Twelve is viewable as a timeline — year over year — building a living archive of life's progression.
- Printing or sharing is one tap away, but preservation happens automatically.

Our North Star isn't just a product metric; it's a philosophy.
Every feature should bring people closer to their own memories — not just to photos, but to meaning.

## Why This Exists

This vision responds to the core problems with modern memory keeping:

1. **Photo overload** — thousands of images, few ever revisited.
2. **No reflection rituals** — our digital lives lack yearly closure or celebration.
3. **Fragmented families** — everyone's photos live in silos across accounts.
4. **Ephemeral tools** — current apps optimize for capture, not remembrance.

**Remember Twelve** exists to reverse these failures and unlock **effortless, emotional archiving** — so every year, every circle, and every person has a tangible story to look back on.

## Supporting Details

- **Differentiator:** Multi-archive model — one app, many circles. Every group has its own Twelve.
- **Analogy:** Like "Spotify Wrapped" for your family — but it never disappears; it becomes your family's library.
- **Guiding Question:** _What if your memories organized themselves into a keepsake every year, forever?_
