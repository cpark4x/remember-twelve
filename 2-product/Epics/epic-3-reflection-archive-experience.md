# Epic 3: Reflection & Archive Experience

---

### Problem Statement

Digital photo libraries grow endlessly, but families rarely revisit them in meaningful ways. Scrolling through thousands of unorganized photos feels overwhelming; curated albums get buried and forgotten. Without a ritual of reflection—a dedicated time and interface for looking back—preserved memories remain unused. Users need a beautiful, accessible way to revisit their curated Twelves annually, compare years side-by-side, and celebrate life's progression.

---

### Objective

Build an elegant reflection and archive experience that makes revisiting past Twelves effortless, emotionally resonant, and ritualized—with year-over-year comparisons, timeline browsing, export/sharing capabilities, and a dedicated year-end review flow that becomes an annual family tradition.

---

### Business Value

- **Retention Driver**: Users who regularly revisit archives have 3x higher retention than those who don't
- **Emotional Moat**: Reflection creates emotional attachment; users won't leave when years of memories are accessible
- **Viral Loops**: Export and share features drive word-of-mouth and family invitations
- **Revenue Enabler**: Print/export features create natural monetization opportunities

---

### Scope

**In-Scope:**

- Timeline view (browse all Twelves chronologically)
- Year-over-year comparison interface (see how circles evolve)
- Year-end review ritual (November-January flow for finalizing/celebrating)
- Export to PDF, print-ready formats
- Share Twelves with family (private share links)
- Notification system (reminders to review, year-end prompts)

**Out-of-Scope:**

- Advanced photo book customization (layouts, fonts, themes) — keep it simple
- Print fulfillment service (partner integrations later; export-only for V1)
- Public sharing or social features (private-only)
- Video/slideshow generation (photos-only initially)

### Risks & Mitigations

| Risk                                            | Impact | Probability | Mitigation Strategy                                                       |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------ | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Users don't return to revisit archives          | High   | High        | Proactive notifications; year-end ritual becomes habit anchor             |
| Reflection feels tedious, not joyful            | High   | Medium      | Design for delight; smooth animations, beautiful layouts                  |
| Export/share features underutilized             | Medium | Medium      | Prominent CTAs in year-end flow; share prompts during reflection          |
| Performance issues with large archives          | Medium | Medium      | Lazy loading, thumbnail caching, progressive enhancement                  |
| Year-end flow feels forced or gimmicky          | Medium | Low         | User testing; make it optional but compelling; learn from Spotify Wrapped |

### Open Questions

- [ ] Should timeline view be horizontal or vertical scrolling? (Aesthetic vs. usability)
- [ ] How far back should year-over-year comparison go? (2 years, 5 years, all years?)
- [ ] Should year-end review be mandatory or optional? (Completion rates vs. user autonomy)
- [ ] What export formats matter most? (PDF, JPEG package, high-res prints, all three?)
- [ ] How do we handle Twelves that haven't been finalized at year-end? (Auto-finalize or prompt?)
