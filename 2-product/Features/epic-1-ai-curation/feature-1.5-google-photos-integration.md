# Feature 1.5: Google Photos Integration

### Epic Context

**Parent Epic:** [Epic 1: AI-Powered Photo Curation Engine](../../Epics/epic-1-ai-curation-engine.md)

**Epic Objective:** Build an AI-powered curation engine that automatically selects twelve meaningful photos per year for each circle using quality, emotion, diversity, and significance signals.

---

### Feature Overview

**What:** Direct integration with Google Photos API that allows Remember Twelve to authenticate, browse, and curate photos directly from a user's Google Photos library without manual exports.

**Why:**
- **User Benefit**: Seamless access to their entire photo library stored in Google Photos; no manual downloading or organizing required
- **Business Value**: Removes the biggest friction point for users who store photos in the cloud; enables real-time curation of cloud-based libraries
- **Technical Foundation**: Establishes cloud photo provider pattern that can be extended to iCloud, Dropbox, etc.

**Success Criteria:**
- Users can authenticate with Google Photos in <30 seconds
- System can fetch and analyze 1000+ photos from Google Photos library
- Curated photos maintain links back to original Google Photos locations
- Zero data stored permanently (respects user privacy)

### Detailed Requirements

#### Authentication Flow

1. **OAuth 2.0 Authentication**
   - Use Google Photos API OAuth flow
   - Request minimal required scopes: `photoslibrary.readonly`
   - Store credentials securely (token encryption)
   - Handle token refresh automatically
   - Support token revocation

2. **User Experience**
   - Simple "Connect Google Photos" button
   - Browser-based OAuth flow
   - Clear permission explanations
   - Success confirmation with library stats

#### Photo Library Access

1. **Library Browsing**
   - Fetch photos filtered by date range (year)
   - Support pagination for large libraries (1000+ photos)
   - Read EXIF metadata from Google Photos
   - Access Google Photos face tags (if available)
   - Filter by album (optional)

2. **Metadata Extraction**
   - Photo timestamp (creation date)
   - Location data (if available)
   - Google Photos categories/labels
   - Face detection results from Google Photos

2. **Caching Strategy**
   - Cache downloaded photos during session
   - Store Google Photos IDs for future reference
   - Never persist user photos permanently
   - Clear cache on app exit or user request

#### Integration with Curation Pipeline

1. **Photo Source Abstraction**
   - Extend existing LibraryScanner to support cloud sources
   - Common interface: LocalPhotoSource, GooglePhotosSource
   - Transparent to existing analyzers (quality, emotional)
   - Seamless integration with TwelveCurator

2. **Results Export**
   - Store Google Photos URLs in curation results
   - Allow users to view selected photos in Google Photos
   - Support re-running curation without re-download
   - Export curated collection as Google Photos album (future)

- Photo content download endpoint (baseUrl)

#### Data Flow

```
User â†’ OAuth Flow â†’ GooglePhotosClient â†’ Google Photos API
                                       â†“
                         Fetch Photos (filtered by year)
                                       â†“
                         Download to temp cache
                                       â†“
                    PhotoQualityAnalyzer + EmotionalAnalyzer

### Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Google API rate limits hit | High | Medium | Implement exponential backoff, batch requests efficiently |
| OAuth token expiry during long curation | Medium | Medium | Implement automatic token refresh, handle mid-process refresh |
| Large libraries timeout (10K+ photos) | High | Medium | Implement streaming download, show progress, allow cancellation |
| Photo format compatibility (HEIC, RAW) | Medium | Low | Convert unsupported formats, gracefully skip problematic files |
| User revokes access mid-curation | Low | Low | Graceful error handling, clear user messaging |
